What do you enjoy and how do you apporach learning?

i find joy in general playing games like chess where critical
thinking is key, and team sports like basketball and football
which teach team collaboration and strategy.

When approaching learning, i like to break down problems into smaller parts,
breaking a big problem into much smallers ones. Doing this allows me to 
execute tasks incrementally, ensuring a solid understanding before tackling
complexity. This strategic, hands-on apporach reflects my pasion for both
problem-solving and practical application.
