Thank you for giving me the oppurtunity to be interviewed for this 
apprentice position with your organization.

I am currently engaged in independent learning at the moment after finishing
my bootcamp in software development bootcamp a couple of months back.
Where i gained experinece working on team projects along with individual
projects with the use of the programming languages such as Java, HTML, CSS
and just looking forward with some of the skills i have learnt into this role.

Since then i have been working on some solo projects to me to put my knowlegde
to use inluding a calorie calculator and a mini pong game using java with the 
use of its own GUI called swing.

Prior to this i stuided Computer Science for a year at university level,
however i didnt think it was thr right fit for me as the content was too
logical maths heavy and it wasnt the right fit for me as i myself thrive
more on practical type work and working collectivly with in a team.


I'm enthusiastic about contributing my skills and knowledge to this role at SwiftCase, 
transforming my passion for software engineering into a meaningful professional journey. 
I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to collaborate with and learn from the 
experienced engineers in the company. Leveraging their expertise will not only enhance 
my own capabilities but also contribute to the innovative and dynamic environment at SwiftCase.
This chance to work alongside bright individuals aligns perfectly with my goal of 
continuous learning and making a positive impact in the field of software engineering.
